                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 425F. Place a large pot of water to boil for the spaghetti. Once the water
                        starts
                        boiling, add salt and pepper along with the pasta noodles and let it cook to al dente.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mix beef and Worcestershire, egg, bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, salt and pepper. Roll meat into
                        1
                        1/2
                        inch
                        medium-sized meatballs and place on nonstick cookie sheet or a cookie sheet greased with
                        extra-virgin
                        olive
                        oil. Bake balls 10 to 12 minutes, until no longer pink.</li>

                        remaining
                        sauce.
                        Place pasta on dinner plates and top with meatballs and sauce and extra grated cheese.</li>
