    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken parmesan recipe is easy to follow, taking at most 30-40 minutes to cook. One of my favorite dishes
        to cook!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil (I prefer olive!)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of italian breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, remove all the fat from the chicken breasts. Then, slice each breast in half to make 6 chicken
            pieces.</li>
        <li>Place your 6 pieces in a bowl, add 1tbs of salt, and cover with cool water. Let the chicken sit in the bowl
            for 5 minutes to clean.</li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl, combine the eggs with milk and stir well.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken breasts from the bowl and season with salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Massage the
            seasoning in well but make sure to not overseason the chicken!</li>
        <li>In two seperate bowls, add the all-purpose flour and breadcrumbs. Coat the chicken with flour and shake off
            any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Fully coat chicken with the egg wash and then drain any excess wash.</li>
        <li>Finally, coat with breadcrumbs. As always, shake off any excess crumbs before leaving your 6 pieces to sit
            aside for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a pan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. After 8 or so minutes of heating, add 3 chicken
            cutlets at a time and fry
            for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the cooked cutlets onto a plate with some napkins to catch the excess
            oil and repeat until all
            of the pieces are fried.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350F and place all of the chicken cutlets onto a baking pan. Coat each cutlet with
            marinara sauce and top
            generously with the mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes. Afterwards, enjoy your yummy (and cheesy!) chicken parmesan dinner!</li>
    </ol>
