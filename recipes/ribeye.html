        <li>1lb 1.5-inch thick ribeye steak</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>

    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, season your steaks with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until it's smoking.</li>
        <li>Add the steak to the skillet. (If you don't hear an immediate sizzle, get the steak out of
            the pan until the skillet is fully heated!)
        </li>
        <li>Cook each side for 30 seconds on high heat.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium-high and cook each side for 2 minutes. Add butter and
            garlic for baste.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the pan onto a plate. With a thermometer, check the center temperature
            for 135F or higher. If the temperature is not immediate, place it back in the pan to cook a
            bit longer.
        </li>
        <li>Let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious rib-eye steak!</li>
