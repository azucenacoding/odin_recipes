    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices of Texas toast</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of milk or cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>A splash of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Butter and vegetable oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small plate, crack 2 large eggs and whisk gently with a fork. Add in the 1/4 cup of milk or cream if
            using.
            Next, add in the 1 tsp of sugar, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, the pinch of salt, and the splash of vanilla extract.
            Resume
            whisking until all the ingredients are combined.
        </li>
        <li>Place a pan over medium heat and add 1 tsp of vegetable oil as well as a small bit of butter. Let the pan
            heat up
            until you can see the milk solids in the butter start to turn golden.
        </li>
        <li>Quickly coat both sides of your Texas toast in the batter and place in the pan. Cook each side for 1-2
            minutes until both
            sides are golden brown. Repeat for the rest of your slices. Remember to re-add the butter and oil between
            each slice!
        </li>
        <li>Remove the cooked slices from the pan onto a plate. Add any fresh fruit, powdered sugar, or whatever you
            like on your
            French toast and enjoy your breakfast!
        </li>
